# Data-Visualization-using-R

For IST 687: Introduction to Data Science course, I build multiple visualization graphs and plots to analyze the US Census and US Arrests rates. I have made use of the ggplot2 library in R programming.

First, I merged both Census and US Arrest rate data sets. I build multiple histograms analyzing each variable in the data set. Then, I build boxplots for each variable and compared it with histograms to see which one gives more insights and a clear, easy to understand the plot. 

I also developed Bar charts and scatter plots to see which variable is important in our merged datasets. To plot the data on the US map, I made use of the ggmap library in R. I plotted multiple crime rates on US Maps.

Library: **ggplot2, ggmap**

Programming: **R**

Visualizations: **Histograms, Boxplots, Bar Charts, Scatter Plots, Maps**
